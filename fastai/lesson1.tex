What do each of the 3 numbers from each epoch of the fit method represent?

loss function value on training set

loss function value on validation set

accuracy on validation set



What are the two parameters of the fit method?

(learning rate, epochs)




A one hidden layer neural network, by the universal approximation theorem, can technically approximate any function with enough hidden neurons, but requires an exponentially increasing amount to approximate more complicated functions.


tab in the middle of typing a method: shows list of methods

shift tab in middle of function parameters: shows you parameters it takes




Clear cell output: CTRL + o


cyclical learning rate stuff goes in here too
