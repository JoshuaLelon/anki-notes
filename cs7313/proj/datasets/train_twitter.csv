1,@SouthwestAir That guy was the flight attendant on my last flight… he was hilarious! ☺
1,@AmericanAir Thanks guys got some sleep. Hang in there DFW with bad weather.
0,@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
0,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.

0,"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."
0,"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"
0,@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
0,@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
0,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
0,"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"

0,@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
0,@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
0,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
0,@USAirways took me 4+ hours to book flights yesterday due to system errors between you and @AmericanAir. paid $320 extra due to time lapse
0,@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
0,@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
0,@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
0,@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
0,@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
0,"@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?"
0,@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed

0,"@USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited."
0,@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
0,@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
0,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
1,@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
0,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.

0,@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
0,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"

0,@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?

0,@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?

0,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
0,@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?

0,@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land
0,@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
1,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
1,@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
0,@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
0,@SouthwestAir on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
1,"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."
0,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.

0,"@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child"
0,@USAirways Everyone on Flight 669 from LAX to RDU enjoyed waiting an hour &amp; a half in baggage claim for their bags just now

0,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
0,@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.
1,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
0,@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
0,@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)

1,@JetBlue OH YEAH!!! great flight down to Mexico with a wonderful crew!! Thank you!!

1,@united that would be great - 1k us651621
0,"@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
0,@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
0,@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
0,@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
0,@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
0,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
0,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
0,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
0,@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
1,@VirginAmerica That's classy.
1,@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAMING
0,"@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!"
0,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
0,@AmericanAir No. It does. You could not be more wrong. http://t.co/66NXZhBbMT

0,@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
0,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
0,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
0,@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
1,@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)
0,@JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service
0,@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
0,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
1,@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer
0,@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
0,@AmericanAir boarded flight 2334 at 8:30am.  Now 11:40.  Still sitting on runway.  Lots o fun
0,@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
0,@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
0,"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
0,"@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out."
0,1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
0,@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
1,"@SouthwestAir, thanks for being so good to us #military folk. It's cold in #StLouis but I sure enjoyed my flight. http://t.co/RcdH183Q1J"
0,@SouthwestAir My husband a first time flyer with you has had the worst experience on board a aircraft just a few minutes ago.
0,@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
1,@united -today the staff @ MSP took customer service to a new level. My father passed away last night &amp; you helped me get home today! Thanks
0,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
1,@SouthwestAir is having a sale! I'm delighted!
0,@SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler
0,@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for over an hour and counting…just need a simple name change http://t.co/5Siczx1oez
0,@SouthwestAir I am trying to change a ticket for travel on Monday that cannot be changed online. Anyway faster than waiting on hold? #anhour
0,@USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
0,"@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in."
1,@SouthwestAir /I really love your customer service Lou Ann in Phx rocks. Thanks SW. #be Ourguest
1,@united Yes ! :D (Y) From @therealaviation on Instagram :)
0,"@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help"

1,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
1,@USAirways Thanks!
0,@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
0,@USAirways missing our connection due to delay out of @LAS. Told not looking good for tmrw either. We will be stuck in #CLT. Help!
0,@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
0,@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
0,@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
1,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,"@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :("
1,@SouthwestAir I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY
0,"@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports"
0,@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
0,@USAirways why cant Sapphire members reach anyone on the phone?
0,@USAirways Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful
0,@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
0,@SouthwestAir crazy how every airline flew out to the northeast tonight except you
1,@SouthwestAir thanks connection thru Nashville have A1 boarding pass get to Dallas gate boarding 40 min before flt get end of B group
0,@SouthwestAir @BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund
0,"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
0,@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
1,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
0,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
0,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
0,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
1,@united They held the plane! Made it!!
0,@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
0,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
0,"@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal"
1,Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
0,"@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy"
1,@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
0,@SouthwestAir why are you literally the worst?
0,"@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but..."
0,@SouthwestAir I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :(
1,@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the Atlanta show ♥️
0,@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
0,@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
0,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
0,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees

0,@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
0,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
0,@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
0,"@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!"
0,@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
0,"@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago."
0,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
0,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
1,"@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed."
1,@SouthwestAir  Please Help. We really want to fly with you. #guessweflyingdelta
0,@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
0,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
0,"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
0,@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
0,@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
0,@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
0,@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
0,@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
0,@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
0,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
0,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
0,"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
1,@AmericanAir Thank You! CC: @packermama1
0,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
0,@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
0,Haha! @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/KmaNLdQbh4”
0,@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
0,@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
0,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
0,"@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course"
0,"@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous."
0,"@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc"
0,@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
0,@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
0,@AmericanAir POOR EXPERIENCE 2day at ord chkin. 8 emp. w/3 cust. 10 waiting. Asked to speak w/supervisor. Told 20 min. In a mtg!! What?!?!
0,@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
0,@united you are terrible.
0,"@VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)"
0,@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
0,@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
1,"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
0,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
0,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
0,"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
0,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
0,@SouthwestAir Flight 2646.  Four hours in the plane on the ground at BWI.
0,@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
0,@usairways 3rd time cut off after 10+ minutes on hold with Chairmans desk?!??? Wth how are we supposed to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?!?!?
0,@JetBlue Why wasn't a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow?
0,@USAirways nervous for flight tomrw out of key west not friendly customer service
1,@SouthwestAir thanks for the drink tickets hook up! Can't wait for my first international flight with you to NAS! #pumped
0,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
0,"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
0,@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
0,@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
0,@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
0,@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
0,@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
0,@USAirways hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate.
0,"@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow."
1,@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it’s hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
0,@USAirways @TheHaileyTate Another blatant lie from @USAirways
0,@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
0,"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"
1,"@SouthwestAir flight 3970, bna-rdu had the most excellent crew today"
0,"@USAirways ur ""response"" was: my ""inconvenience was of no matter."" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair"
0,@VirginAmerica I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email
0,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
0,@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
0,@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
1,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congrats!
0,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
0,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
0,"@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!"
0,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
0,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0,@SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route?
0,@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
0,@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
0,@USAirways NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on.
1,"@JetBlue thanks so much for help Us, u r amazing!"
0,@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
1,"“@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!!"
0,@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
0,@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.😭
0,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
0,@SouthwestAir How to I rebook on-line when it keeps telling me that it's a reserv number for a past date (this morning)? Holding for 2hrs.
0,"But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united."
0,"@united remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see"
0,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
0,"@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting."
0,"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
1,@SouthwestAir loving the boarding to go to Chicago #KeepItMovin'
1,@united thanks
0,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
0,@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?
0,@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
0,"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
1,@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
0,"@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes"
0,@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
0,@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
0,@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
0,@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
0,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
0,@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member
1,@SouthwestAir Thx for your quick response and action! bf will make good use of the voucher #satisfied #happycustomer
0,@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
0,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
1,@JetBlue yes! Announced we will take off. You're on it! Thank you!
0,"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
1,@JetBlue #Bluemanity @AirlineAdviser loves this. Have a great time flying this
0,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
0,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
0,@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
0,"@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today."
1,@JetBlue love it as always!
0,@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
0,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
0,@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
1,@united Thank you for responding so promptly! I look forward to the 240 kms drive to the office to file a claim.
0,@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
0,@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
0,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
0,@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
0,@united I will not be flying you again
1,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
1,@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
0,"@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience"
0,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
0,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
0,@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.
0,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
0,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
0,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
0,@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
1,@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
0,@AmericanAir trying to book a flight on hold- can't get through to a representative on the phone- Advice?
0,@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
0,"@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd..."
0,@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
0,@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
0,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
0,.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
0,@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
1,@JetBlue Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC!
0,@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
0,@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
0,@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.
0,"@SouthwestAir no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times. Can you assist in Cancelled Flighting reservation?"
0,@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
0,@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
0,@USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight.
1,@SouthwestAir Thanks so much!
0,@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
0,@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
1,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
0,@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
0,@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
0,@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
0,"@JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane."
0,@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
0,@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
0,@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
1,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
0,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
1,@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
0,@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
0,".@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same."
0,@USAirways @rylietolbert15 wow you wouldn't say
0,"@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell."
1,"@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter."
0,@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
0,"@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?"
0,@united already missed  connection ugh
0,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
1,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
0,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
0,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
0,@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.
0,"@SouthwestAir 9 hrs in Baltimore, still not going to get my baggage to greenville w me. This is just unbelievable."
0,@USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming
0,@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
1,"@USAirways Stars aligned. Connecting flight was delayed into CLT. Made it! Thanks, glad to know someone is listening. Time for 80° in MoBay!"
0,.@SouthwestAir received an error online and have been on hold for over 1.5 hours. Completely unacceptable.
0,@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
1,@JetBlue I just wanted to say flight attendant fitz was the best tonight on flight #1326 bwi/Bos. Great guy and made the flight fantastic!
0,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
0,".@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it."
0,"@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on."
0,@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
0,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
0,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
1,"@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30"
0,@SouthwestAir been waiting for 70 minutes on hold because yall Cancelled Flightled my return flight. Answer the phone!!!
0,@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
0,"@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!"
0,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
0,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic ."
0,@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
0,@VirginAmerica you suck!
0,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.
0,@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
0,"@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes."
0,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
0,"@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to ""changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY"". I'm on hold now to get help."
0,@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
0,".@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded..."
0,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
0,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
1,@SouthwestAir Me on one of your planes!!! Thanks for taking me Arizona 184! http://t.co/Finq5Fh6ue
0,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
0,@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
0,@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
0,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
0,@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
1,@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
1,@JetBlue love traveling with Jetblue. Cant wait to go to Paris oui oui!!! NYC was awesomeee!
0,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
0,@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
0,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
0,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
1,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"
0,"@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim."
0,"@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help"
1,@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!
0,@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
0,@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
0,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
0,@SouthwestAir hates guitar players. Chgd for oversize AND extra bag on my acoustic guitar. Epic fail.
0,@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
0,"@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well"
1,@AmericanAir v nice of you to give me a breakfast voucher for $7 in an airport. That almost got me a whole drink!!
0,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
0,@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
0,@VirginAmerica #wtf I paid for direct flight on purpose not to have to stop for fuel exhausted frequent flier and nothing for inconvenience!
0,"@USAirways this is ridiculous.  I have a 6:00 AM flight and two hours of rest, wasted!!!"
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
1,@SouthwestAir following. Thank you.
0,@united thx. Come hell or high water...
0,@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
0,"@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies."
1,@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
0,"@SouthwestAir  Flight today from PHL to DAL Cancelled Flightled. 96 min on hold, rebooked for tomorrow. Now that flight is Cancelled Flightled.  On hold again."
0,@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
0,@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
0,@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
0,@USAirways your customer service at CLT is terrible!!! My flight was delayed from JFK for 2 hours!  Get to CLT to horrid customer service!
0,@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
0,@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
0,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
0,@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
1,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
1,@SouthwestAir love..luv the addition of the passbook option.
0,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
0,@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
0,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
1,@AmericanAir Nicest people ever flight to Chicago.Thanks David Deane &amp; Norma Sedholm for making me feel comfortable ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
0,@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
0,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
0,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
0,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
1,"@JetBlue Great Thank you, lets hope so! Could you please notify me if flight 2302 leaves JFK? Thank you again"
1,"@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some ""white revive"" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single."
1,"@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock"
0,@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
0,. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
0,"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
1,"@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!"
0,"@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?"
0,@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
0,@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
0,@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
0,@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
0,"@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
0,"@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra"
0,@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
0,"@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?"
1,"@united ok, have sent u info via DM. I appreciate your help and consideration. 😊"
1,@JetBlue I'm #MakingLoveOutofNothingAtAll on my #brandloveaffair to #LAX https://t.co/kdHRUF54sW
0,@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
0,@united still no response??
1,@AmericanAir thank you for responding rather quickly btw
0,@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
0,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
0,@USAirways Hold time to book award travel from Gold status: 4 HOURS and counting!!!! + 4 days of calling #usairwaysfail @AmericanAir
0,"@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for"
0,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
1,@SouthwestAir Southwest is definitely my favorite airline to fly! :D
0,@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
1,@SouthwestAir thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir
0,@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
0,@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
0,@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
0,@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
0,@USAirways ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue
0,"@SouthwestAir can't checkin online for 2:00 flight tmrw fr. Cancun. ""Undefined error"" &amp; 800# not working.Family of 4 don't want Cgroup! Help"
0,"@AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough."
1,@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.
0,@SouthwestAir thanks! I expected a wait... Just not that long. :)
0,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
1,"@united done just now, thanks."
0,"@VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home!"
0,@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
0,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
0,@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
0,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0,@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers
0,@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
0,@JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.
1,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
0,"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
0,@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
1,@SouthwestAir is the best. Case and point. https://t.co/ucVnilMb4x @ryand2285 #HappyBirthday
0,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
1,"@USAirways Awesome USAir, TYSVM &lt;3"
0,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
0,@USAirways what do I push to rebook with that 800 number
0,@AmericanAir my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning.
0,@AmericanAir hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me?
0,@united why am i mot getting my refund?
0,@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
0,@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
1,@USAirways thank you!!
0,"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
0,@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
0,"@SouthwestAir went to front restroom on plane, on sink sign that said no water, use hand sanitizer. First time I've ever seen that. GROSS!"
0,@USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
0,@AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy?
0,@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
0,@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
0,@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
0,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
1,@JetBlue nothing but praise for you helping our lady make her flight to CHS tonight!  #impressed
0,"@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho"
1,@USAirways Flight # 604. Thanks.
0,@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
0,@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
1,@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
1,@USAirways HA!  You're fun.
0,@JetBlue any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
0,"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA."
0,@JetBlue - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable
0,I just need a place to sleep when I land without accommodations in PLS @AmericanAir!
0,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0,"@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
0,@JetBlue Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ?
1,@AmericanAir Always enjoy my time. Now on the plane to DFW!
1,@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.
0,@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace
0,.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
0,@SouthwestAir why am I still in Baltimore?! @delta is doing laps around us and laughing about it. # ridiculous
0,"@USAirways grades for this trip:

Flight timeliness: 👎✈️
Cancelled Flightations: 👎😬
Customer Service: 👎😡
Flight attendants: 😊👏"
0,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
0,@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
1,"@JetBlue incidentally, Sheila at JFK deserves a raise because she's awesome."
0,@SouthwestAir I know one thing @Delta would NEVER treat their customers like this!!!!
0,STOP THIS “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn”
0,@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
0,@VirginAmerica is the website down?
1,"@JetBlue you are officially my favorite, thank you for the wonderful service at JFK"
0,@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
0,@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
0,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
1,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
0,@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
1,@SouthwestAir hello #SouthwestAir I'm  happy to be flying with you this morning DAL-MDW #4053 looking forward to a comfortable fight
0,@USAirways I have been calling for 3 days!
0,@USAirways fuck you.
0,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
0,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
0,@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
0,@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
0,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
0,@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
0,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"
0,@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
0,@USAirways Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp; counting..
0,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0,"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
0,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
0,"@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage."
0,@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
0,@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
0,@SouthwestAir @PoteetTJ had to fly @Delta MCO-&gt;CMH for $400 b/c we cldnt reach SWA to reroute SWA 3104 Cancelled Flightlation. Voucher wld help.
0,@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?
0,@SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
0,"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"

1,@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
0,@SouthwestAir jumped the gun a little Cancelled Flighting our flights? No other airline is Cancelled Flighting out of Louisville. You're ruining my vacation.
0,@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
0,@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
0,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
1,"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
0,@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
0,@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
0,@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
0,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
0,@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
0,"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
0,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
0,@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
0,@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
0,"@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?"
1,@SouthwestAir listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #RaganDisney
0,@SouthwestAir Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter? thanks you.
1,@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
0,"@USAirways I need help. In air on #717 to CLT from PHL. Conf: D1MQF5 Need confirmed on #1776 to BNA at 10:30. Been bumped all day, need home"
1,@united thanks for more timely updates.
0,@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
0,@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
0,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
0,@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
0,"@SouthwestAir my wife has now been on hold for 90 minutes....I get weather is bad, but this is insane. #customerservice #customerloyalty"
1,@united thnx
0,"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"

1,@SouthwestAir @karajusto OK we will! Thank you!!!
0,@JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please?
0,"@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off."

0,@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
1,@Jetblue first airline to use #applepay in flight #airlines
0,@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
0,@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
0,@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
0,"“@AmericanAir: @RussellsWriting Russ, please contact Reservations at 800-433-7300 for reFlight Booking Problems options.” Good luck with that!"
0,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?"
0,@AmericanAir lost @LeslieWolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #Miami to #NewYork #LGA no response and no luggage more than 37 hrs ltr
1,@VirginAmerica got it squared away. Someone picked up as soon as I tweeted. Should have tweeted sooner. 😉
1,@SouthwestAir thanks for the quick response. Should I call daily it wait the 5 days.
0,"@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading."
0,@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
0,@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
0,@USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us
0,@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
0,"@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?"
0,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
0,"@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!"
0,@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
0,@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
0,@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
0,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
0,@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
0,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
0,@JetBlue that's not a answer!
0,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
1,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
0,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0,@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
0,@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
1,@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
0,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
1,"@AmericanAir gotta love those skycaps, solving problems faster than anyone else in the terminal. And they did it with a smile on their face"
0,@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
0,@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
0,@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
0,"@USAirways if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob"
1,@JetBlue Wish Everyone felt like you
0,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
0,@AmericanAir I've been doing this all night. Can someone please help? I need my flt fixed. Please???
0,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
1,@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
0,@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
0,@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
0,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
1,@SouthwestAir had a great flight to and from Cabo last week with my family #smoothflight #frequentflyer
1,@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
0,@SouthwestAir On hold with airline 45 min and counting. Service is terrible!

1,@VirginAmerica got it. All set - Thanks!
0,"@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up"
1,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
0,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
0,@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
0,@USAirways 2 hours and counting waiting to get into a gate in Philadelphia. Just icing on the cake for a miserable flight experience
0,@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir  Also your on-hold message is trying to sell Valentines Day gifts.  Over a week Late Flight.  Sounds about right for USAir
0,@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
1,@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
0,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
1,@SouthwestAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
0,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
0,@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
0,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
0,@USAirways Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate.
0,@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
0,“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved

1,@JetBlue you're killing me now. :-) You got me! #smitten #trueblue
1,@SouthwestAir DeLacy P is a compassionate professional! Despite the flight challenges she made passengers feel like priorities!!🌟🌟
0,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
0,@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
0,@united and waiting
1,@JetBlue I can't wait to hear back from you regarding the internship opportunity! 😊

0,@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
1,@SouthwestAir the new logo is going to look amazing on the airplanes
0,@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
0,@JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
0,@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail

1,@SouthwestAir Thank you for your time!
0,"@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!"
1,@USAirways Thank you!!! On our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number 😊
0,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
0,@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
0,@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
1,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
0,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
0,@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
1,@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed
0,"@united troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! http://t.co/nmbHNGnMkI"
1,"@JetBlue Annnndddd, I just booked my flight. That was easy."
0,@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
0,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
0,@AmericanAir Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I'm hating. But my job is concerned
1,@JetBlue incredible PR team. 👏👏👏👏
0,@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
0,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
0,@SouthwestAir I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading.
1,@SouthwestAir Hey sourhwest can you send me to Atlanta to see @Imaginedragons ? I will fly southwest forever. U guys are the best airline!
0,"@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating."
0,"Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole.."
0,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
0,"@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight."
0,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
0,@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
0,@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
0,@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
0,@JetBlue please provide me your direct email for me to explain.
0,@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
1,"@united gave me a smile today, with a Zero Award... ;-) Computers have some sense of humour :-) http://t.co/JNqNbk7HuT"
1,@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
0,@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
0,@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
0,@USAirways never flying you guys again. your customer service is awful
0,@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
0,@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
0,@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated
0,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
0,@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
0,@united who can tell me where they are?
0,@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
0,@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
0,@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
1,@JetBlue boarding the back of the airplane first. Like a boss. #sosmart #jetblue #frequentflyerappreciates #alsoyayforsnacks
0,"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
0,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
0,"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"
0,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
0,"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
1,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
0,@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
0,@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
0,@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
1,"@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!"
0,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
0,@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!

0,@USAirways looks like you lost another customer  when you stranded @41CGQueen at CLT she vows never to fly with you again #smoothtransition

1,@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
0,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
0,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
0,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
0,"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
0,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
1,.@JetBlue 4 min response time. I'm impressed! I'm in. It's official.  :-) #trueblue  JetBlue gets social.

1,@VirginAmerica Very nicely done. 👏
0,@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
0,@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
1,@JetBlue I want to give a warm thanks to your crew at Logan airport for still getting me to the DC area after Cancelled Flightlations this morning!
0,@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
0,"@USAirways obviously your corporate definition of PATIENCE needs to be reviewed.
#Pleasehurryup #answerphone #reschedulemyflight"
0,"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv"
0,@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
0,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
0,@JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
0,@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
0,@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
0,@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
0,"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
0,".@united You may ""dislike delays"" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time."
1,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp
0,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
0,@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
1,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
0,@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay

0,"@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd."
0,@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
1,@JetBlue Was nice to see your Veterans Advantage Program at the gate on Sunday @ MCO.Keep up the good work at  JetBlue
0,"@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful"
0,@USAirways not Cancelled Flightling #837 because you don't want to put us in a hotel for night is our guess

1,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
0,"@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow."
1,@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?
0,@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
0,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
0,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
0,@JetBlue the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It's staticy #ithelpsabit
1,@SouthwestAir flt 3867 crew  #OrangeCounty to #Denver is The #BEST! Weather delay but pilots just invited the kids to see the cockpit! #luv
0,@USAirways can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger.
0,@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
1,"@AmericanAir no worries, loved flying with you guys. Thanks!"
0,@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?

1,@united #FirstClass to #London on my way to #LondonFashionWeek #LFW15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
0,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
0,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
0,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
1,"@AmericanAir 
I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?"
0,@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
0,@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight and I'm stranded in St. Louis. Not sure what to do. No other flight until tomorrow. Am I to sleep in airpt
0,@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
0,@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
0,@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.

0,@USAirways abandoned 40 Boston bound fliers...someone in management needs to #saveface and #showup
0,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
0,"@USAirways wow this airline is a joke, absolutely horrendous customer service. you guys should be ashamed."
0,"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."

0,@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
0,"@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight"
0,@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
0,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.

0,@JetBlue you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
0,@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
0,@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
1,@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
0,"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar."
0,@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
1,@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
0,"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."

0,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
0,"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."

0,"@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not."
0,"@JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I'm giving you a second chance. I'm just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home."
0,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
0,@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
0,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."

0,"@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection."
0,@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.

1,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
0,@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
0,@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
0,@JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
1,@SouthwestAir oh my god thank you so much!!! I just sent you a DM
0,"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
0,@USAirways and I can't get through on any phones

1,@JetBlue great will do once I land in JFK
0,@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
0,@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.
0,"@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB"
0,@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
0,@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
0,"@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded."
0,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
0,@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
0,@SouthwestAir I was on hold for two hours and finally hung up. I was able to do what I needed to without customer service eventually.
0,@SouthwestAir Gary Kelly should be ashamed of himself running a corporation in this way
0,@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
0,@SouthwestAir @jlittle100 Double up with this comment. PHL to anywhere South Florida is GONE GONE GONE. Hello US Air
1,@VirginAmerica #thankyou the DAL-AUS route makes my day!!!!
0,@SouthwestAir almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
0,@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
0,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
1,@united thnx
0,@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY

0,@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
0,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0,@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
0,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0,@AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
0,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
0,@USAirways why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr?
0,@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
0,"@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your ""go to"" maneuver?"

1,@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
0,@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
0,@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
0,@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
0,@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
0,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!

0,@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
0,@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
0,"@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response."
0,@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
0,@AmericanAir Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
0,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."

1,@VirginAmerica I love your guy's song! We're dancing to it for our high school dance revue

0,"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"
0,"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"

0,@USAirways waited for 3 hours NO LUGGAGE line too long left airport when flight Cancelled Flighted WHERE does luggage GO? On hold for 1 hour so far

0,"@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
0,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
0,@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
1,@AmericanAir Always love opening the upgrade email.
0,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
0,@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
1,"@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO"
0,@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
0,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
0,"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."
0,@JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
0,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
0,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
0,@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
1,@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!

0,@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
0,"@USAirways has failed me all day long, should I blame it on @AmericanAir ?"
0,@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
1,@AmericanAir @contactcej thanks!
0,@united Suck
0,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
0,@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
0,@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
1,@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
0,@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
0,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
0,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
1,@AmericanAir awesome flight this morning on AA3230! Awesome crew and even landed early!
0,"@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help"
0,@AmericanAir we're still stucked in the airport. #AADelay #AA919
0,@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
0,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
0,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
0,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
0,@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
1,"@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?"
0,@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
0,@united She 👏 won't 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
0,"@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me."
0,@USAirways should look into better service✌️
0,@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
1,@JetBlue thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery
0,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
0,@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
0,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
0,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
0,"@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"
0,"@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls"
1,@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free.
1,@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
0,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
1,@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW
1,@united that's fine. I'll take them.
0,"@SouthwestAir no, thanks. I think we have it straight!"
0,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
1,@JetBlue mission accomplished: gave @paulgordonbrown  a hug http://t.co/LT1pYKfvRq
1,@VirginAmerica I love the dancing little richard. cool beans.
0,.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
0,"@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel"
0,@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
0,.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
0,@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
0,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
1,@SouthwestAir rules.
1,@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
0,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
0,@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
0,@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.

0,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
0,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
0,"@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too.."
1,@AmericanAir thanks so much!
1,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0,@SouthwestAir u texted that my flight from Denver to SD tmrw is Cancelled Flightled? Been on hold for an hour trying to get help. Any other flights?
1,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
1,@SouthwestAir male flight attendant on flight 3913 from Orlando to Indy was AMAZING! He needs a raise 👍 Had the best experience with him
1,@VirginAmerica Thanks!
0,@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
1,@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel 🎉🎉🎉
0,@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost
0,@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
0,"@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!"
0,@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
0,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
0,"@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather….call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?"
0,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
1,@JetBlue Thank you for the service credit. And to @PamGrout for positive thoughts.
0,@JetBlue love you guys. You know that. But I paid for prem. wifi toplay @vainglorygame. No go. Ping terrible / up too http://t.co/CmjRIWOP7O
1,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
1,@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
0,@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?
0,"@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here."
0,@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
0,@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
0,@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
0,@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
0,@JetBlue why won't the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin?
0,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
1,@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
0,@united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we'll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq
0,"@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out."
0,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
1,@JetBlue thank you 😊 standing in line now!
0,"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
0,@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
0,@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
0,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
1,@JetBlue sent :-) curious to see what kind of comp we get.
0,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
0,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
0,@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
0,@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
0,@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info
1,@JetBlue ok. I'll book JB to JFK then book to ATH. Thank you.
0,@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
1,@AmericanAir  CXL flight. rebooked 2 PAX no problems. Thank you and everyone at AA for helping us all out!
0,@SouthwestAir can't fly in precipitation and @Delta has planes that don't work after 5. 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow.

0,"@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke"
0,@JetBlue no more than half an hour wait. It's unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this
0,"@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless"
0,@JetBlue I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail
0,@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
0,"@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was ""frozen""! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver"
1,@JetBlue I did...#FlyFi worked well and was free aboard this flight
0,@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
0,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
0,@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
1,@united look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 Hope you like this beauty 😉 http://t.co/NS1aCFqCdQ
0,@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
0,@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
0,@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
0,@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
0,@JetBlue all day
0,@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
0,@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
0,"@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly"
0,@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
1,@JetBlue in the sky on flight 833 from BOS to SFO. Awesome crew! Helene rocks!
0,"@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst."
0,@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
0,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
0,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever

1,@SouthwestAir just sent another 4 drink coupons....I think I have over 30 coupons now. free drinks anyone?
0,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
0,@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
0,@united Can you transfer my bags too?
1,"@SouthwestAir thanks for your attention, I've been flying southwest for 3 years and haven't had this issue in the past."

1,"@SouthwestAir thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though."
0,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
0,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
0,@USAirways your customer service is horrible
1,@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
1,@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
1,@United  great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! Looking forward to my global first class suite!
1,@SouthwestAir Yes! I did and the bags came straight to my hotel. Thank you ...you guys rock!

1,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
0,@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
0,@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
1,@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
0,@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
0,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
1,@SouthwestAir What an awesome flight Dallas 2 NY. Virgin America refused bc of my child's peanut allergy but u guys didn't. Thanks! 👍😊

1,@JetBlue thanks for a speedy flight time recovery.
0,@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
0,@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
0,@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
1,@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
0,"@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher..."

1,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0,@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
0,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?

1,@SouthwestAir I managed to get sorted out over the phone. Good luck dealing with the snow in Texas!
0,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.

1,"@SouthwestAir have to be honest, didn't expect a fast response, thank you!  Off to #Chiberia we go!"

0,@VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn't exist. Emails bounce.
0,@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
0,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
1,@JetBlue Thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
0,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
0,@SouthwestAir want to explain why I was on hold for 2+ hrs tonight trying to reach customer service only to learn they're only there Mon-Fr?
0,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
0,"@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?"
0,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
0,"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
0,@USAirways - have dinner reservations in a few minutes -- and I've been trying to get through to you since BREAKFAST. #onholdwith
0,@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
0,@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
0,"@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board"
1,@SouthwestAir give this guy a raise....great start to flight from AZ to MKE..

0,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
0,@USAirways Round Two of being THE worst airline ever.
0,"@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation."
0,@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
0,@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
1,@VirginAmerica I was so glad it was mentioned. I took my first virgin flight a few years back and it was a transformative experience.
0,"@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues."
0,@USAirways 'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...?

0,.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
1,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.

0,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
0,"@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable."
0,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
0,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
0,@AmericanAir Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG!
0,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0,@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
0,@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
1,@JetBlue I will! Thank you!

0,"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
0,"@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?"

0,@USAirways : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks 🐳
0,@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
1,@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
0,@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
1,@JetBlue their names are both Angel (seriously - how cool is that!). Truly FANTASTIC service!

0,"@JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare."
0,"@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed."
0,@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
0,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
1,@AmericanAir Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow.
0,@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
1,@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
0,"@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation."
0,"@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic"
1,@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
0,@USAirways That link doesn't work on mobile.
0,@united ouch not fair
0,@AmericanAir On hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever-anyone there?
0,@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
0,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
0,"@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!"
0,.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
1,"@JetBlue why yes, yes it does!!!!  Great trip down!! Thanks for the lift!!!!"
1,"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
0,@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
0,@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
0,@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
0,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0,@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
0,@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
0,@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
0,@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
0,@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
0,"@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful"
0,@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
0,"@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?"
0,@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
0,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
0,@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
0,@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
0,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
0,@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
1,@SouthwestAir about time! Thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir I have had 4 flights Cancelled Flightled through yall!!!! Im sick of it 😠😠
0,@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
0,@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
0,@USAirways - almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer?
0,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
1,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
0,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
0,@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
0,@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
0,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
0,@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
0,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
0,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
0,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside
1,@JetBlue your employee Charles cave at the gate at MSY went above and beyond to help try to help me find my glasses. Thought u should know
0,@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
0,"@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)"
0,"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"
0,@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
0,"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
1,@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!
0,@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
0,@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
0,"@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation."
0,@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
0,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
0,@USAirways #usairways Raleigh NC; baggage carousel staff were aggressive towards people waiting 1 1/2 hrs for bags. Flight 699
0,.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
0,@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
0,@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
0,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
0,@SouthwestAir paid for my own $200 rental car just to not go through this for the 3rd day  :(
0,@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
1,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
0,@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
0,@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
0,@USAirways now on hold for 90 minutes
0,"@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our ""on time"" flight 1170 out of MCO"
0,@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
0,@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
1,@JetBlue great.
0,"@SouthwestAir you have the worst service, you Cancelled Flightled all your flights FLL to PHL all @USAirways flights flew. Stuck in FL 3 days. #done"
0,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..

0,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
0,@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
0,"@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!"

0,@SouthwestAir Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance?
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..

0,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
0,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
0,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
1,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
0,@united Dmed you. Thank you
0,@united any solutions?
0,@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
0,"@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!"

0,"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."
0,@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
0,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
0,@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
0,"@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK"

0,"@AmericanAir Define ""sincerely"". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media."
0,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
0,"@united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”"
1,@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
0,"@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone."
0,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
0,@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
0,"@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected"
1,Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
0,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
0,"@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb"
0,@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
0,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
0,@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
0,@SouthwestAir My flight to KC has been Cancelled Flighted and the next available isn't till Tuesday?! What am I supposed to do for 3 nights?????
0,"@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH"

0,@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
0,@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.

0,@USAirways Charlotte Staff needs prayer....disappointed in response to mishaps ......lotttttttt of pissed off people here!!!!
0,@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?

1,@JetBlue you guys operate a world class company and for that I thank you
1,@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
1,@united Thank you!! 😊
0,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
0,"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
0,"@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine."
1,@united did I win :)
0,"@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?"

0,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
0,@JetBlue that sucks. Oh well.
1,@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
0,@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
0,"@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr"
0,@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?

0,@JetBlue but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason.
0,@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
0,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE

1,@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail

0,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.

0,"@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each."
1,@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
0,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
1,"@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries."

0,"@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL"
0,@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
0,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
0,@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
0,@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
0,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.

0,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
1,@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
1,@SouthwestAir Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points.
0,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
0,@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
0,"@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
0,@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
0,@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
0,"@AmericanAir Well if you won't let me handle my reservation/change online, &amp; your Reservation call # hangs up on me wtf do I do?? Bullshit."
1,"It really is nice, though. The snack fridge…that you can just get up and take stuff out, like a dorm common room, is genius. @JetBlue"
0,@united it most certainly was not.
0,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
1,@JetBlue thanks for your reply. It was flight 1572.
0,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
1,@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
1,@USAirways thanks :)
0,@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
0,@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service when trying to reach them by phone.
0,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
0,"@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look ""normal"" ????"
0,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
0,@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
0,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
0,"@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all..."
0,@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
0,@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
0,"@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?"
1,@VirginAmerica I’m looking forward to watching the Oscars on my flight home tomorrow. I might even get something bubbly to drink! ;)
0,@VirginAmerica The Flight Booking Problems section of your website seems to be broken on Chrome. Might wanna look into that.
0,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
0,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
1,"@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response."
0,@AmericanAir I need assistance reFlight Booking Problems a flight from dfw to lit
0,"@USAirways #fail when the inbound flight arrives after the scheduled outbound departure, and still ""on time"" http://t.co/k0MHZrJF6e"
0,@SouthwestAir FIND A WAY TO Cancelled Flight FLIGHT 310!!!!!!!
0,@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
0,"@JetBlue It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)"
1,"alright @JetBlue.... done! alternatively, if you'd like to charter a private jet for me to PITT i will gladly accept :)"
0,@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
1,"@JetBlue Also, thanks for your prompt replies. I'm really impressed--and you're not just brushing me off. Much appreciated!"

0,@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
1,@JetBlue ok thank you for the quick response JetBlue still the best comp
0,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
0,@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
0,"@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone 
Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it"
0,@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
0,@USAirways horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags.
1,@united DM sent. Thanks so much for the strong customer service!!
0,@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
0,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
0,@USAirways @PHLAirport how can a plane scheduled to come in on time and actually happen. Then you bozos don't have any room us. #incompetent
0,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0,".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
0,"@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned."
0,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
0,@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
1,@AmericanAir I wish I could remember all of their names!
0,@SouthwestAir  at fort launder dale and the gate agent can't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone...ridiculous
1,@JetBlue Haha you're doing everything right! Don't change a thing! Slash this Twitter engagement just makes you even cooler! #bestairline
0,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
0,@SouthwestAir  reservation (FEHQNE)  21FEB15 | DCA-RSW. Want refund not credit for Cancelled Flightled flight please.
0,@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
0,"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
0,@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
0,@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
0,"@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?"
0,@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
0,@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
0,@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
0,@JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
0,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
0,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
1,@SouthwestAir yes please
1,@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
1,@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
0,@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..

1,@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
1,“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/g12sn5qsqZ”- no... Yall better than this
0,@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
0,@USAirways so I guess you are ok with people being sexually assaulted on your flights nice customer service
0,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
1,"@SouthwestAir was in a line a mile long at sky harbor this morning. Your staff was courteous and expeditious.  Thank you. 
#onechildfourbags"
0,"@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards"
0,@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.

0,"@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?"
1,"@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine

1,@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
1,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for two smooth, safe and fast flights! #Boston #Houston #LUVSWA http://t.co/elhxUV0Uj1"
0,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
0,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
0,"@AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!"
0,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
0,@USAirways what's the deal with the flight computer network?
0,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
0,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.

1,"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
0,@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
1,@AmericanAir ok no worries. Thanks for the straight story. It's appreciated.
0,@USAirways will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice
0,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
0,@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail

0,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
0,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
0,@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
0,"@JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on"

0,@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
0,@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
0,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
0,@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
0,"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
0,@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
0,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
0,@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
0,@USAirways your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir

0,"@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night."
0,"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
0,@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
0,@SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!!
0,@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
0,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
0,@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!

0,"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
0,@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
0,@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
0,@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
0,"@USAirways I have LITERALLY been on hold since 3am est.PlatinumEventually hung up &amp; again back on hold. Understand weather, but ridiculous."
0,@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
0,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
0,@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
0,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
0,"@AmericanAir My flights tomorrow were Cancelled Flighted, can't do anything online, and can't get through on phone. Help?"
0,@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
0,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0,@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.
0,@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
0,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
0,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
0,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
0,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
0,@JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
0,@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
1,@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure.
0,@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you

0,@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
1,@VirginAmerica you have the absolute best team and customer service ever.  Every time I fly with you I'm delighted.  Thank you!
0,"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
1,@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
0,@united how come I have no baggage updates.
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir Suggestions , been on hold 2 hrs for flight that is now about to pass departure...Dealing w ny weather, need change"
0,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.

0,@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
0,@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
0,@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
0,@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
0,@SouthwestAir 40 minutes still haven't talked to one person #shocking phone is gonna died before I talk to anyone http://t.co/iWoiGRLHXb
0,"@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason"
0,"@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
0,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
1,@VirginAmerica and again! Another rep kicked butt! Naelah represents your team so beautifully!! Thank you!!!
0,@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
0,@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
0,@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
0,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
0,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
1,"@JetBlue btw, her name was Samantha and she won over everyone on the flight"
0,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
0,@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
0,"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."
0,@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
0,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.

0,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC."
1,@AmericanAir Not necessary.  I am confident the excellent in-flight staff will make the appropriate report.
0,"@USAirways stuck at the gate in Charlotte, NC waiting for ""release papers"" and a fix for a broken computer system."

0,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice"
0,@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
0,@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.
0,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
0,"@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel"
0,@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care

0,@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
0,@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
0,"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
0,"@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again"
0,@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
0,@united no still trying to get home.
0,@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞
1,@SouthwestAir had an amazing experience with your staff at DIA last night. I was blown away by their hospitality with my wife on crutches
0,"@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable."
1,@SouthwestAir loved it!
0,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
0,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
0,"@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?"
0,@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
0,@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
0,@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes

1,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
0,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0,@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
0,@SouthwestAir been on hold over an hr to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight. Do you have anyone working???
1,"@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!"

0,"@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?"
0,@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
0,@AmericanAir what are my chances of making a connection to El Paso (AA504) with DFW from SAT (AA200) delayed 30 minutes?
0,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
1,@AmericanAir Thanks!

0,@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
0,@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
1,@SouthwestAir Yes! Just a few minutes after my tweet. She was able to reschedule her flight. Thanks!
0,@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
0,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.

0,@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
0,@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
0,"@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?"

0,@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
0,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0,@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
1,"@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere"
0,".@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag. 

Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly."

0,@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.

0,@SouthwestAir your app isnt working and i take off in like two hours help
0,@AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don't credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking

0,@AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.
0,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?

1,@AmericanAir thank you we got on a different flight to Chicago.
0,@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
0,@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0,"@SouthwestAir where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!!"
0,@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
0,@USAirways will you hold #475 today for connecting passengers coming from delayed flights?
0,@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
0,"@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy"

0,"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
0,@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.

0,@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!

0,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
0,@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
0,@USAirways when do we get our baggages? @usaireays 699 LA to RDU http://t.co/vU5lBZXtRX

0,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
0,@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
1,@SouthwestAir y'all the real MVP with these prices...
0,"@SouthwestAir Flight was Cancelled Flighted, I've been on hold for 50 minutes with no human interaction. I wanna get away."
0,@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
0,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
0,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
0,@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
0,@AmericanAir United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can't check in #help

0,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
1,@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
0,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
0,"@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."
0,@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
0,@JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I'll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer
0,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
0,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
0,@USAirways @franchise02 my friend has been on hold for 1.5 hours and still counting!
0,@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.

0,@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
0,@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?

0,@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
0,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0,"@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5"
1,@SouthwestAir constantly providing wonderful views and service! #SouthwestLuv http://t.co/9UNxqOTzIK

0,@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
1,.@JetBlue handled @0xjared's question like social media pros. Good practice for when our transportation systems are all run by friendly AIs!
0,@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
0,@AmericanAir flight was 2488 out of EWR STOP AT DALLAS THEN TO LA. I need to be in la tonight!
0,"@AmericanAir I'm trying to register since 12:00,don't want to be separated from my brother during the15hours flight!There're few places left"

0,@SouthwestAir Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international
0,"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."
1,"@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service"

0,"@SouthwestAir - wow! 100 minutes on hold, so far. Now phone is dying..."
0,@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
1,@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
0,@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
0,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.

0,@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
0,@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
0,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0,"@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again."
0,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
0,@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒
0,@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though

0,@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver member😒
0,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
1,@SouthwestAir Left my computer on the plane. Two weeks Late Flightr they found it and sent it to me. #greatservice.  #happy #customer
0,@USAirways tell my professors that when I don't show up to class/write my midterm because I'm stuck with no flights home 😠
0,@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
0,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
0,@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.

1,@SouthwestAir so glad u guys do business w/ more class than UR competitors @SpiritAirlines 😏
0,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
0,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
1,@JetBlue Love you guys😍😍😍 http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
0,@USAirways delays to the max

1,@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
0,@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
0,Why @JetBlue let someone from black Twitter in their multimedia department?
0,@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
0,"@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful."

0,@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
0,@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip

0,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
0,@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
0,"@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on."
0,".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
0,@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
0,@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
0,@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
0,@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
0,@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0,@SouthwestAir yes. Hung up and called a different number.

0,@JetBlue I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
0,"@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming"
0,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
1,@USAirways thanks so much!
0,@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
0,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
0,@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
1,"@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best"
0,"@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!"
0,@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
0,@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.

0,@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
0,@USAirways Sadly I'm currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can.
0,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
0,@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
0,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
0,"@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow"
0,@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
0,"@SouthwestAir He is going to file a formal complaint, this should have never happened. Please direct us to the right department."
0,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"

0,@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
0,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
1,@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
1,@SouthwestAir I miss mine terribly. A +1 for my 30th anniversary would be amazing. It would mean LUV is in the air. #dontmakemebeg

0,@USAirways  where's my bag?  In line 200 deep at DCA. Agents say call 800 #.  800# says talk to agents. Abysmal customer service

0,"@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline"
1,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.

0,@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
0,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose

1,"@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation,helpful representatives &amp; a comfortable flying experience"
1,@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
1,@JetBlue ugh always know a way to my heart 😘🙌
0,"@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue."

0,@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
1,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
0,@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
0,@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
0,@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
1,@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
0,"@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert."

0,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
0,@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
0,@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
1,@JetBlue ok!!! That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll reach out if I have any other questions.
0,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
0,"@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours."
0,@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
0,@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
0,@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
0,@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?

0,@SouthwestAir can you make a premium wifi that I can pay $30 for that is decent? #slow-fi
0,@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
1,@AmericanAir ok thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
0,@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
1,@USAirways me too!
1,"@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I DO like your airlines, congrats! : )"

0,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
0,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
0,@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
0,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
0,@USAirways flight 614 keeps telling a few more mins to take off its been an hour. First time with you not the best #lies #brokenpromises
0,@USAirways so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ✈ #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense!

0,@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
1,@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
0,@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
0,"@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn’t a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now"
0,@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.

0,@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
0,@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
0,@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
0,"Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?”"
0,"@USAirways stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for ""sickcrew"".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today."

0,@AmericanAir stranded in Miami because your automated system keeps hanging up on me for two days. Help !

0,@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
0,"@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins"
0,"@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag."
1,"@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx"
0,@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
0,@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice

0,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
0,@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
0,@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
0,@AmericanAir it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
0,@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
0,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924
1,@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
1,@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
1,@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  love all three but you really can't beat the classics!

0,@SouthwestAir has the WORST customer service of any airline I've ever flown.
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
0,"@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion"
0,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
1,@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO
0,@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.

1,@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!

0,@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
0,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
0,@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
0,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
0,@SouthwestAir not if its travel Credit you used to buy and it expires on the day you find a lower rate
0,@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???

1,@SouthwestAir you are the #Official airlines of #DivadaPouch aka #ThePoopQueen http://t.co/XXY2d2iMnP
0,@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame

0,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
0,"@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles"

0,@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
0,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
0,"@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon"

1,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
1,@JetBlue This could be the beginning of a BLUEtiful relationship :) #lifeneedsfrosting
0,"@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting."

0,@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
0,"@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful."

0,"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever."
0,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
0,@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
0,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
0,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
1,@united thanks
1,@AmericanAir thanks.....

0,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
0,@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.

0,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
0,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice

1,"@VirginAmerica Thanks so much for the awesome support, you guys rock!"
0,@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
0,@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
0,"@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways"

0,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
0,@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
0,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
0,.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
0,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.

0,"@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?"
0,@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
1,@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I 💙 you!

0,@USAirways spent 1.5 hours in line trying to get on a flight home tonight only for it to be Cancelled Flightled an hour Late Flightr. Not even snowing at DCA
0,@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.
0,@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
0,@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
0,@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
0,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
0,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0,"@SouthwestAir can't speak with customer service for 2hours, still on hold! Do you guys work?#nogood"
0,@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
0,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
0,@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
0,"@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed."
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
0,@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
1,"@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}"
0,@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
0,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
0,@USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.
0,"@SouthwestAir your customer service is terrible, you're terrible, thought you should know."
0,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
0,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."

1,@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
0,@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
0,@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
1,"@JetBlue if I tell you I like that @warriors pick, will that get me that bump to first class? :)"
0,@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
0,@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
0,@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
0,",@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I'm not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue"
0,@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
0,@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
0,@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
0,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
0,"@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!"
0,@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
0,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE."
1,@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
0,@USAirways can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours
0,@USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797
0,@USAirways Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing.
0,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
0,"@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though."
0,@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
0,@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
0,@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
0,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
0,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0,@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
0,@USAirways thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer.

0,@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
0,"@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh"
0,@USAirways have you ever lost luggage with an infant and a 4 year old? Then customer service never answered the phone. I've tried all night.
0,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
0,@usairways Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled. said I'd have to pay $75 for earlier flight at next gate. Today @delta proactively offered same for $0
0,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
0,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
0,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
0,@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
0,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
0,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..

1,@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
0,@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE 😤#ANGRY

0,"@AmericanAir you have my money, you change my flight, and don't answer your phones! Any other suggestions so I can make my commitment??"
0,@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
1,"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time!"
0,@USAirways @united each says the other has my luggage. On hold almost 3.5 hrs with @USAirways. @united hung up 3x. http://t.co/dr5oCtp1DY

0,@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
0,@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
0,"@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International."
0,@JetBlue when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt;
1,@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
0,@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
0,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
0,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
0,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
0,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
0,@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
0,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
1,@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
0,"@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped"
0,@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
0,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
0,@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w

1,@southwestair cool shot of the moon and one of your fleet http://t.co/kl9BAiMES6
0,@SouthwestAir sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.
0,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
0,"@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on"
0,@united problem is on laptop not phone
0,"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
0,@USAirways if ur going 2 charge $20 for wi-fi make sure it works. #Brutal #DialUp b a 100 by the time things load. #TheEnd #GoodDay
0,@JetBlue bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!!
0,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
0,@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
0,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
0,"@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here."
1,@SouthwestAir pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job!
0,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
0,"@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model."
0,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
1,@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! 😁
0,@USAirways is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182
0,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
0,@united well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
0,@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
0,@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
0,@SouthwestAir hey... Why don't you add the intl number to your error when checking in. Going on 6 hrs looking for a way to checkin. #cancun
0,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
0,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
0,@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
0,@united Monday evening.
1,@JetBlue haha no need to apologize 😁 I'll be Flight Booking Problems sooner than Late Flightr. I love JetBlue
0,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
0,"@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr"
0,@SouthwestAir do you ever reinstate Cancelled Flighted flights?
0,@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?
0,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
1,@united kind of cool to run into your boss man at SFO. http://t.co/bm9O2K5X5J
0,@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
1,@united Thank You
0,@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
1,@JetBlue - loving Capt Joe on our flight from BOS to SFO #633. This should be fun!
1,@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
1,"@JetBlue Not trying to make you look bad, on your website it says: ""Due to weather in the Charleston, NC"" Its actually in SC, not NC"
0,"@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service."
0,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
0,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
1,@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.
0,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
0,@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
0,@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
1,@united I hope so too :)
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
1,"@JetBlue done, thank you!"
1,@SouthwestAir Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;)
0,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
0,"@SouthwestAir she's still stranded in DC. Sat until 3:30am with 100 other kids. They were starving, and exhausted."
0,"@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue"
0,"@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please"
0,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
0,@SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir 3 hours on hold got rebooked on a new flight yesterday. I asked for a new itinerary/confirmation email to be sent
0,@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
0,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
0,"@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board"

0,"@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious ""entertainment"" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse"
0,@AmericanAir I get &amp; can appreciate that. I've just had so many problems in the last year flying with guys... Pretty aggravating.
1,@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
0,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
1,@JetBlue perfect! Probably need some coffee to stay awake during the night ;)
0,@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
0,@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
0,@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
0,"@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?"
0,@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
0,@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
1,"@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all"
1,"@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back."
0,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
0,@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer

0,"@AmericanAir for tomorrow some sites show flight 1642 from ewr Cancelled Flightled, is it?"
0,@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
0,@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
0,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
0,@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
0,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
0,@SouthwestAir stop ur bs promos of ✈️anywhere starting at 79$ I click and everywhere I'd fly=130$ The only place thats 79$ is CLE #NoThanks

0,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
0,@JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers
0,@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
0,@united it's been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I'm counting on it! #TeamUSA
0,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
0,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
0,@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
0,@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
0,@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
0,.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
0,@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
0,@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
0,"@SouthwestAir - I have spent 87 minutes (and counting) on hold w/ you today. After first 48 minutes, I gave up. Trying again &amp; on 43rd min."
0,@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

1,@JetBlue thank you
1,@JetBlue Thanks for the complimentary upgrade to first.  You are the best!
0,@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
0,@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
0,@americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what's the delay
1,“@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY” 👏👏
0,@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
0,@AmericanAir there is two hour wait
0,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
0,@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
1,@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sure👌
0,@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
1,@united stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail.
0,@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
1,@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!
0,@USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down.
0,@usairways the. Worst. Ever. #dca #customerservice
0,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
0,"@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; ""Anthony"" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down."
0,@USAirways US Airlines 699 LA to RDU is holding onto baggages for an hour already and everyone is still waiting!?
0,@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
0,@AmericanAir today's wait was a violation of #dot #passengerbillofrights http://t.co/GxvFumn3iZ
0,@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
0,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
1,"@SouthwestAir Once again, I was able to change my flight without any fees... oh and the two free checked bags.  Best airline ever."
0,@AmericanAir really
0,@USAirways I need an actual person in customer relations for a refund. What # can I call? I will dispute this charge on my credit card.
0,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
0,@SouthwestAir not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18.
0,@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
0,@USAirways no one is coming to line. On hold for 4 hours. Can u help here if I provide conf code?
0,@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
0,No JetBlue… Just… no “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/mB3IPGs8zQ”
0,@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
0,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
0,@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
0,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
0,@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
0,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
0,@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
0,@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
1,@USAirways Thank you!
0,@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
0,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0,"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
0,@AmericanAir better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!
1,@JetBlue keep going back and forth with being able to board and then not. But great agents in savannah!
0,"@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI"
0,@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto
0,"@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues"
0,@SouthwestAir Had to pay a $25 fare difference on a change but can't seem to find the receipt for it. How can I get a copy for reimbursement
0,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
0,"@JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated."
1,"@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)"
0,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
0,"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
0,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
0,"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
0,@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
0,@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401

1,Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
0,@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment

0,"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""
0,@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
0,@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
1,@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!

0,@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ

1,@USAirways I made it- thx.
1,@AmericanAir Eventually the call got through. Not sure what changed. Thank you a lot though!
0,@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
0,@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
0,@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
0,@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help
0,"@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?"
0,@JetBlue Flight is 100% full.
0,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
0,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
0,@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous

1,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
0,@AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight?
1,@AmericanAir Lady at B1 ABQ for 5347 on 2/23 was of a great service to all among several Cancelled Flightlations
0,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
0,"@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised...."
1,@JetBlue I will. I love flying with you all. Great service.

0,"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
0,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
0,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
1,@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
0,@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
0,@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
0,"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
1,@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
0,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks

0,“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience*
0,@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.

0,@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
0,@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
0,See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4
0,@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
0,@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
0,@USAirways needs to get it together in Indy. Only 2 ticket agents and a line to the door. Felt bad for ppl who missed their flights.
0,@USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail
0,@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
1,@AmericanAir wow that's helpful.
0,"@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
0,"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
1,@JetBlue #kudos! And we're done and heading to warmer weather!
0,"@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting."
0,@USAirways Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing
0,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
0,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
1,Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
0,"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"

0,@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
0,@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
0,@AmericanAir make that 7hours now
0,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
0,@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
0,"@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales"
0,@USAirways how do you lose a pilot????
1,"@SouthwestAir I love and appreciate the fact that you guys rarely Cancelled Flight flights and are on time, but I need a Cancelled Flightlation this time. 🙏"
0,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
0,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
0,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
1,@AmericanAir why thank you!! Yayayay!!
0,"@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!"
0,"@usairways on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE"
0,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
0,@JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.

1,@JetBlue you're still the best
0,@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
1,@SouthwestAir love them! Always get the best deals!
0,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
0,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
1,@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :)
0,"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
0,@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
0,"@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."

0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID"
0,@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
0,"@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated"
0,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
0,@USAirways any tips on getting a hotel that your airline won't get for any of us even though we were told that we'd make our flight?
0,@SouthwestAir I'm here @ChicagoMidway airport.  I've waited 3 hours for my bag. No one knows shit. Mgmt knows nothing.  #Very mad customer

0,"@AmericanAir flight 2470 tomorrow, have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?"
0,@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
0,@USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg
0,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
0,@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
0,"@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow."

1,"@USAirways despite mechanical issues and many delays followed by a Cancelled Flightlation, still getting to Vegas thanks to great gate agents!"

0,"@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!"
0,"@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped."
0,@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
0,@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
0,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.

0,"@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight"
1,"@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive"
0,@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
0,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
0,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"

0,@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
0,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
0,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
0,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail

0,@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
1,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
0,"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"

0,@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
0,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
0,@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
0,@JetBlue only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can't just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason.
0,@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
0,@united where's my damn bag??
0,@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now

0,"@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???"
0,@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
0,"@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue"
0,"@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!"
0,@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
0,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
1,"@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?"
0,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
0,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
0,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
0,@SouthwestAir bad weather and multiple Cancelled Flighted flights has us all scared!  Noted for next time.
0,@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
0,.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
0,@SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it's just on the nxt flight up. I've got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I'll just turn my sweatshirt inside out
0,@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
0,"@SouthwestAir I love you guys, but even Comcast has a better phone help system. A simple callback system would fix most of the problem..."
0,@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
0,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
0,@AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email
0,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
0,@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
1,@USAirways Mellani B. and whole team in Columbia SC are absolute superstars. Incredibly helpful.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir  nvm my bad it's been an hour and a half #thanks
0,@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
0,"@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD"
0,@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
0,@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
0,@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
0,"@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?"
0,@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
0,@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
0,"@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral."
0,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
0,"@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines."
0,@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited

1,@JetBlue I definitely will. Thanks!

0,"@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me"

0,@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'

1,@SouthwestAir No worries at all!!! I would rather be safe on the ground than take any chances. Yes! Tomorrow AM if BNA reopens ☺️
1,@USAirways it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day!
0,"@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems."
0,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
0,@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
0,"@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!"
0,@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
0,@USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt
0,@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
0,@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
0,@SouthwestAir I am trying to book another flight and apply my credits that I had from another flight but I can't find them.
0,"@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"

0,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
0,@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
0,@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
0,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
0,@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
0,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
0,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
0,@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
0,@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
0,"@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?"
0,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
0,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
0,@SouthwestAir On hold waiting to make special accommodations for my mom who is traveling 1 hour and 24 minutes on hold.  Unacceptable!
0,@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler

0,@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
0,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
