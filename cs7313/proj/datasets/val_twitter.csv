0,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
0,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.

0,@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
0,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
0,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
1,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA

0,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?

0,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.

1,@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
0,@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
0,@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
0,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
0,@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
0,@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
0,@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
0,@united yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I'll figure out car rental changes and such.

0,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
0,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
0,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
0,@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.
0,@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent
0,@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
0,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
0,"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
0,"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" 
My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
0,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
0,@united I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight
0,"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
0,@united no. U guys suck. I'll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too.
0,@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
0,"@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone"
1,@united nice and early back home! http://t.co/geG4nghmIE
0,@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
0,@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
0,@united no u don't
0,"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."
0,@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
1,@united awesome thank you very much for the help
0,"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
0,@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
1,@united Thank you so much for your help with my birthday trip! Tickets are confirmed! :-)
0,"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice"
0,@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
0,@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
0,"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
0,"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
0,@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
0,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
0,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
0,"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
0,@united you guys suck!
0,"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember"
0,"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
0,"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
0,@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
1,@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
0,@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
0,"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go"
0,"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
0,@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
0,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
0,@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
0,@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
0,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
0,@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
0,"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
1,@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
0,@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
1,@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
0,@united delayed another hour
0,"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
0,@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
0,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
1,“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
0,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
0,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
0,"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"
0,"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
1,@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
0,"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"

1,@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
1,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
0,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
1,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
0,@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
0,"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
0,"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
0,@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
0,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
1,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
0,@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
0,@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
0,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
0,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
0,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
0,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
0,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
1,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
1,@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH

0,"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
0,"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
0,@united @abigailedge Another glitch??

0,@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
0,@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
0,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
0,@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
1,@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
0,@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
0,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
0,"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
0,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
0,@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
0,@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
0,@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
0,@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
0,"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"
1,"@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY  as a… http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU"
0,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
0,@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
1,@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
0,"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
0,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??

1,"@united I was well taken care of, thanks. I've already been sent a survey request &amp; I'll share my positive experience (despite delay)"
0,@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
0,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
0,@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
0,@united smiling? NOT!!
0,"@united ""We like hearing from you."" So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi"
0,@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.

0,@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
0,@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.

0,"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"

0,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
0,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
0,@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
0,@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
1,"@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!"
0,@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!

0,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
1,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
0,@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required

1,@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
0,"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"

1,@united thank you!
1,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
0,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
0,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
0,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
1,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"
1,@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
0,@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
0,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
0,@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
0,@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
0,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
1,"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."
0,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
0,"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"

1,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
0,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
0,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
0,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?"

0,"@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion."
0,@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
0,"@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights"

0,@USAirways sucks.  Flt 2692 Late Flight by 20 mins missed my connection.  Thanks for the 10 bucks and a middle seat on the next flt.
0,@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
0,"@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25"
0,"@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out @united answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight."
0,@USAirways I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible
0,@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
0,"@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways."
0,@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive
0,"@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem, but wait for luggage for 4 hours?? IT MUST BE DELIVERED!!"
0,"@USAirways Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you"
0,"@USAirways to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3)"

0,@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
0,@USAirways haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck
1,@USAirways Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there!
0,@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
0,@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
0,"@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?"
0,@USAirways enormous lines at customer service and two agents what kind of service is that .. http://t.co/ffanixJhwh
0,"@USAirways I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!!"
0,@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
0,@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
0,@USAirways if one with @AmericanAir why can't you use American miles????
0,@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours
0,@USAirways on hold for 30 minutes &amp; counting to Cancelled Flight reservation booked within 24 hours - can I do it here? conf code: F6DK04 / XZMSCW
0,@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
0,@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
0,@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
0,@USAirways now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer
0,"@USAirways flight 813 DCA to CLT stuck waiting on CLT ATC. Cmon #FAA Missing flt 826 CLT to MBJ, hope you can rebook me! 816?"

0,"@USAirways any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting..."
0,"@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes..."
0,"@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25."
0,@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
0,@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
0,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
0,"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
0,@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
0,@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
0,@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
0,@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
0,@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
0,@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
0,@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
0,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
0,@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.

0,@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
0,@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
0,@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
1,@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
0,@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
0,@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
0,"@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail"
0,@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
0,@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
0,@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
1,"@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!"
1,"@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!"
0,"@USAirways Literally all that says is ""Case open""  What good is that to me?"

0,@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
0,@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
0,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
0,@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
0,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
0,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
0,@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
0,"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
0,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
0,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
0,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
0,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
0,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
0,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
0,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
0,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
0,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.

0,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
0,@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
0,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
0,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
0,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful

0,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
0,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
0,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
0,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"

0,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
